        <main>
            <p>I am 25 years old and live in Missouri with my wife, Andrea, and a miniature poodle named Huckleberry. I am the Director of Operations for a reverse logistics company that helps return broken products to be remanufactured. In 2020, I received a bachelor's in business with an emphasis in supply chain management and returned for the Crosby MBA.

            On an ideal Saturday, I would wake up early to go on a run, play golf, and grill with my family. However, a long list of chores and house projects often limit my options. I enjoy staying busy; learning skills and meeting people. One day I hope to run an ultra-marathon and watch my favorite soccer team, Tottenham Hotspur, play in person.</p>

                <Blockquote>“In the midst of <strong>chaos</strong>, there is also <strong>opportunity</strong>” – <em>Sun Tzu</em></Blockquote>
                <p>In every opportunity you have to lean into discomfort. Without discomfort you will seize to move, and without movement, you will fail to grow. Throughout my career, I have experienced this first hand.</p>
