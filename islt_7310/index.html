        <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>My name is Isaac Sherman. I have many interests both professional and personal and want you to learn more about me throughout this website. I hope you can learn from my career (short, albeit) and have at least one takeaway about leadership from my experiences.</p>
        <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p>I chose the professional/portfolio website to highlight my work experiences and reflect on my professional journey. Every position I have worked so far, even going back to being a cashier at a grocery store in high school, has helped shape me into the leader I am today. This website will give an opportunity to share that journey with others and hopefully inspire at least one person along the way.</p>
