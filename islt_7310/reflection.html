            My interest in supply chain management and operations started from a young age. In fact, I come from a manufacturing family. My father worked a 35-year career in plant operations for Kraft Heinz. I was always interested in his stories. He explained how things were made in a factory and that they were only successful with the right intersection of an engaged team and sound engineering process. He always spoke highly of his team and looked for the ways to build them up; maximizing their strengths and minimizing weaknesses. He helped me feel like a winner growing up and now I want my teams to feel the same way.
        </p>
        <p id="reflect-2">
            Operations is in my bones! Everything about it excites me. On a daily basis I get to work with people and seek opportunities for continuous improvement. On a personal level, each day adds to my toolkit of experience and is a chance to refine my leadership skills such as strategic thinking and talent development. On top of this, I am able to pair the concepts learned in the Crosby MBA program at Mizzou to maximize the outcome in the workplace. Financial concepts such as net present value in finance helped me evaluate capital investment projects. HR concepts in recruiting have helped me partner with our HR team to establish new hiring processes at our company. Lastly, supply chain optimization processes such as linear optimization have helped me maximize our operation through labor planning.

        <p id="reflect-3">   
            I see every day as an opportunity to apply new skills and then learn what adds value and what doesn’t. Today I am taking a course on web development and am genuinely looking forward to the new concepts I obtain in coding. At this stage I don’t know if software development is in my career pathway, however, learning to program will certainly help me communicate business needs to our software team.

            The first three years of my career have been marked by three promotions; drinking from a firehose of information and new challenges at each step. One thing I know for certain is that the change will keep coming and it is up to me if I learn from each one or let them knock me down. At the end of the next three years I want to be ready for whatever comes next. At first glance, within the hierarchy of SRC, this would be a general manager role. I know the only way to be prepared for a role like this is to take advantage of every learning opportunity and establish a wide base of experiences to support the whole organization. My personal development would be marked as a success if I was ready for this step three years from now.
