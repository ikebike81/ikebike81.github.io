                    <p>Working at Sabai taught me valuable lessons in customer service and leadership while working in a fast-paced food-service environment. I took pride in the meals we served to students. I personally experienced many poor meals while a Freshman living on campus at Mizzou and never wanted a student to experience that while eating at Sabai. Serving as the student manager challenged me in motivating team members that were there for just a paycheck. I approached these employees on a personal level. Simply trying to learn more about them and connect with them socially. Once you establish trust and care they become part of the team and want the whole to succeed. I worked with so many great students and value the relationships that helped sustain me through my undergraduate years.</p>

                        Contributed to the materials team as a supply chain intern, focused on process improvement, order expediting, and purchasing. I helped fill whatever gaps persisted. Shortly after beginning the internship, a materials buyer left the company and I was asked to step into their role to assist the department by purchasing packaging materials for the operation, such as labels, foam, corrugated boxes, and adhesives. Utilizing NSE’s ERP software, Realtime, I created Macros to streamline the buying process and absorb the position while still allowing time to complete the primary tasks I was onboarded to complete.

                <div class="reflection">
                    <p>NSE was a pivotal step in my professional development. My manager trusted me with a level of responsibility I only thought “full-timers” should receive. I greatly valued his advice and constantly sought ways to improve the business. One change was cleaning the purchasing process for packaging materials by utilizing Google Sheets to collaborate with each department to track orders, maintain inventory levels and establish reorder points to avoid stockouts. This taught me the importance of a system and true accountability of the operation. They depended on me to have the inventory on the shelf when they needed it. I was constantly told to never let something as trivial as pallets shut down the operation. Newstream taught me the importance of communication with outside vendors, organization, and continuous improvement.</p>

                        As the operations manager over the reverse logistics warehouse for a large on-highway trucking company I led a team of 26 employees to process over 300 thousand units of core to supply the customer’s remanufacturing programs. In the first year, the department exceeded target revenue by 16% while only increasing labor by 4%. Drove results through short-term continuous improvement efforts called “MiniGames” in line with the SRC culture of open book management.

                <div class="reflection">
                    <p>Stepping into the operations manager role forced me to swallow my pride in many ways. I reached a point where I realized I could only be as successful as my team. I had to be my team’s advocate and champion and help them reach the performance I knew they were able to unlock. Starting with the first two weeks in the department I spent a day with every employee and every job function, simply viewing the process, asking questions, and listening to the team’s ideas for improvement. I then spent the next 9 months simply trying to implement their ideas. One change was the implementation of a mobile inspection cart to eliminate excess walking and rework caused by hand-writing inspection notes. Simple improvements added up to a significant increase in revenue with marginal increases in labor costs. The years as operations manager were critical to my development as a leader.</p>

                    <p>
                        As director of operations for SRC Logistics, I am responsible for establishing an operation to provide service to 18 customers for core management and warehousing services. I lead a team of 80 employee owners focused on providing the best possible services to our customers to support the remanufacturing industry. I serve as the primary vehicle of communication between top leadership and the floor employees and have the responsibility to develop the next generation of leaders in the company. SRCL accomplishes this through routine leadership reviews and a learn by doing approach. Along with constant leadership development and communication, I leverage data to detect trends in performance and quality to make business decisions and drive results.

                <div class="reflection">
                    <p>Only eight months in to the role I have grown substantially. At the start of the year I established personal goals aligned to the cascaded goals from the CEO of the organization. The goals circled around cost reduction targets, employee engagement, and operational KPIs. At this stage all goals are trending favorable as a result of building a team on the foundation of trust and mutual respect to accomplish a goal. I have their back and they have mine. There are countless improvement initiatives still on the table and irons in the fire, but I’m confident with the right team and processes in place we will knock them down and find ways to improve the customer experience.</p>
